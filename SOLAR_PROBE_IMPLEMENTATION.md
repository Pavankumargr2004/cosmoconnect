# Parker Solar Probe Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the NASA Parker Solar Probe feature on the home page, replacing the James Webb Space Telescope section.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added State Variable
- Added `isSolarProbeFullscreen` state variable to manage the fullscreen view
- Added `setIsSolarProbeFullscreen` setter function

### 2. Removed James Webb Section
- Completely removed the James Webb Space Telescope section from the home page

### 3. Implemented Parker Solar Probe Feature
- Created a medium card displaying information about the Parker Solar Probe mission
- Added an image of the spacecraft from NASA's image library
- Implemented click functionality to open the NASA Eyes interactive visualization in fullscreen
- Added a back button to exit fullscreen mode

## Implementation Details

### Medium Card Features
- Responsive design that fits well on the home page
- Hover effects with shadow and border enhancements
- Gradient title text for visual appeal
- Descriptive text explaining the mission
- "Explore Mission" button with gradient styling
- NASA image of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft

### Fullscreen Mode
- Opens NASA's Eyes interactive visualization of the Parker Solar Probe mission
- Dark overlay background with backdrop blur effect
- Header with mission title and back button
- Fullscreen iframe containing the NASA visualization
- Back button to return to the home page

### Styling
- Consistent with the existing app design language
- Uses the same color scheme (violet, cyan, blue gradients)
- Responsive layout that works on all device sizes
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## User Experience

1. **Home Page View**: Users see a medium-sized card with information about the Parker Solar Probe mission
2. **Interaction**: Clicking anywhere on the card opens the fullscreen visualization
3. **Fullscreen View**: Users can explore the interactive NASA visualization in detail
4. **Navigation**: Users can easily return to the home page using the back button

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [isSolarProbeFullscreen, setIsSolarProbeFullscreen] = useState(false);
```

### Card Component
- Uses a div with cursor-pointer class for click functionality
- Contains an image, title, description, and button
- Responsive design with aspect-video container for the image

### Fullscreen Component
- Conditionally rendered based on `isSolarProbeFullscreen` state
- Fixed positioning to cover the entire viewport
- High z-index to appear above all other content
- Backdrop blur for modern glass effect
- iframe embedding NASA's Eyes visualization

### Event Handling
- Click on card sets `isSolarProbeFullscreen` to true
- Click on back button sets `isSolarProbeFullscreen` to false

## Benefits

1. **Educational Value**: Provides users with an interactive way to learn about the Parker Solar Probe mission
2. **Engagement**: The fullscreen visualization offers an immersive experience
3. **Accessibility**: Easy to access from the home page with clear navigation
4. **Consistency**: Maintains the app's design language and user experience patterns
5. **Performance**: Only loads the visualization when requested by the user

This implementation replaces the James Webb section with a more relevant feature for the home page while providing an engaging educational experience about NASA's groundbreaking Parker Solar Probe mission.
